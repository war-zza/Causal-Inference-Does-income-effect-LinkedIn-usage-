Causal Inference Analysis on LinkedIn Usage and Income Level
This project investigates whether income level causally affects the likelihood of adults using LinkedIn. The analysis uses a causal inference approach, 
combining a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and Bayesian statistical modeling, with data sourced from the Pew Research Center.

Project Overview
Social media platforms, including LinkedIn, show distinct usage patterns across demographic groups. By examining how income and age influence LinkedIn usage,
this project seeks to understand if higher income levels directly impact the likelihood of LinkedIn engagement or if other variables, such as age, play a mediating role.
